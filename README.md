# Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

**The possible outcomes are**:

    *  Rock destroys scissors.
    *  Scissors cut paper.
    *  Paper covers rock.
    *  If thereâ€™s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
